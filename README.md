# blackjack
# Can run the blackjack.py or blackjack-onefile.py. Former imports the bjfuncs.py and bjclass.py, the latter has it all in one file. Make sure pygame is installed. Alternatively, there is an .exe file in the build folder. Keep the images in the 'cards' and 'misc' folder in the main directory for the game to function.
