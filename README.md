# blackjack
# Can run the blackjack.py or blackjack_one-file.py. Former imports the bjfuncs.py and bjclass.py, the latter has it all in one file. Make sure pygame is installed. Alternatively, there is an .exe file in the build folder. cx_freeze was used to build the .exe version. Keep the images in the 'cards' and 'misc' folder in the main directory for the game to function.
